15-112 F22 Term Project

The name of my project is Badminton Tourney, a 2D badminton game. There
is singleplayer mode, which is is played against one of the three bots in the
game ranked by difficulty, and multiplayer mode, which is played with two
players on the same computer. The controls and instructions are listed when
you click on the help icon in the top left corner of the start page. 
Everything else should be straightforward in terms of playing the actual game.

To start the game, simply run the main file, called Badminton_Tourney.py.
The only separate file is the AI file which is imported in the main file.
